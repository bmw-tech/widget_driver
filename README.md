A Flutter presentation layer framework,  
which will clean up your widget code, make your widgets more maintainable and easier to test and removes the need to mock thousands of dependencies in your widget tests.  
Let's go driving! ðŸš™ðŸ’¨

The `WidgetDriver` framework is built up on different dart packages. The core package which contains the actual framework is the `widget_driver`. Then there are some helper packages which support with code generation and making testing easier.

Here is an overview of all the packages:

## widget_driver  [![pub package](https://img.shields.io/pub/v/widget_driver.svg)](https://pub.dev/packages/widget_driver)

- [Source code](widget_driver)

The core package which provides the `WidgetDriver` framework.

Import it into your pubspec `dependencies:` section.

## widget_driver_generator [![pub package](https://img.shields.io/pub/v/widget_driver_generator.svg)](https://pub.dev/packages/widget_driver_generator)

- [Source code](widget_driver_generator)

The package providing generators to automate the creation of your `TestDrivers` and `WidgetDriverProviders`.

Import it into your pubspec `dev_dependencies:` section.

## widget_driver_annotation [![pub package](https://img.shields.io/pub/v/widget_driver_annotation.svg)](https://pub.dev/packages/widget_driver_annotation)

- [Source code](widget_driver_annotation)

The annotation package which has no dependencies.  

You do not need to import this since the `widget_driver` package already imports it for you.  
But if you need/want to import it then import it into your pubspec `dependencies:` section.

## widget_driver_test [![pub package](https://img.shields.io/pub/v/widget_driver_test.svg)](https://pub.dev/packages/widget_driver_test)

- [Source code](widget_driver_test)

Contains helper classes/methods to support with:

- Testing your `DrivableWidgets`
- Testing your `WidgetDrivers`
- Mocking your `TestDrivers`

Import it into your pubspec `dev_dependencies:` section.

## example

- [Source code](widget_driver/example)

A Flutter example app showing how to set up all dependencies and how to use the WidgetDriver framework and how to test your widgets and drivers.

### Publish to pub.dev

To make the plugins accessible, we want to publish them to pub.dev. [publish_all_packages.yml](.github/workflows/publish_all_packages.yml) contains a job that deploys all four plugins to pub.dev. This job is named `Publish all packages to pub.dev` and is triggered manually. If you want to check first if it's safe to publish the plugins, you can run `dart pub publish --dry-run` in the root of each plugin.
