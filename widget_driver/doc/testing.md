# Testing

This is where the `WidgetDriver` framework shines and shows its power ðŸš€

One big inspiration for creating `WidgetDriver` was to solve the issue of widgetTests and mocking madness.

When you use `WidgetDriver` then your `DrivableWidgets` can be tested in isolation.
Meaning that you only need to care about and focus on the current widget under test.

You do not need to care about any implementation details of any of your child widgets.
So you never need to provide mock instance to them.

You widgetTest only needs code which focuses on the current widget and 90% of that mocking code can be removed!

## Testing your DrivableWidgets

### Create a mock driver

When you are testing your `DrivableWidgets`, you will still need one mock.
You need to mock the `driver` which that widget is using.

*But that is it, all other dependencies used by other widgets can be ignored.*

To make it easier to mock your driver, we have created a base mock class which you can extend.
This gives you functionality from [mocktail](https://pub.dev/packages/mocktail) that you can use on your mock instance.

```dart
import 'package:mocktail/mocktail.dart';

...

class MockMyWidgetDriver extends MockDriver implements MyWidgetDriver {}

...

mockMyWidgetDriver = MockMyWidgetDriver();
when(() => mockMyWidgetDriver.title).thenReturn('Hey this is a mocked title');
```

### Using a mock driver in DrivableWidget

When you have created your mocked driver, then you also want to use it in your widget.

To make it easy to provide a mocked driver into a `DrivableWidget`, we have created a helper class which can provide this.

Create an instance of `MockDriverProvider` and pass it the mocked driver as value and the `DrivableWidget` as a child.

```dart
final myWidget = MockDriverProvider<MyWidgetDriver>(
    value: mockMyWidgetDriver,
    child: MyWidget(),
);

await tester.pumpWidget(myWidget);
// Do your widget testing now
```

And that is it! Wow!  
Now your widgetTests can get back to focus on testing your widget. 
And they can stop being mock-factories ðŸ˜„

## Testing WidgetDrivers

Okay, so now you know how to test these new widgets.  
But what about the `WidgetDrivers`. How can you test these?

Well they are easier to test than widgets, since they are not ui components.
So basically they are just unit tests. You do not need to find some buttons and do some fake tapping.
You just have to test that they provide the correct property values depending on their internal dependencies.

**But**, yes there is a but, it becomes a bit tricky to test `WidgetDrivers` since they need the BuildContext in their constructor.

It is not super straightforward how to get an instance of the build context.
But luckily we have created some helper code for you to make this easy.

To test your `Drivers` you need your tests to use the `testWidgets` test function (just like you do when you test widgets)

```dart
void main() {
    testWidgets('Some driver test', (WidgetTester tester) async {
        // Put your driver test code here
    }
}
```

### Create a driver

To create your driver you will need a helper function.  
This is because the `Driver` needs a build context as a parameter to its constructor.
To help you with this we have created a helper function on the `WidgetTester`.

This is how you create your `Driver`:

```dart
testWidgets('Some driver test', (WidgetTester tester) async {
    final driverTester = await tester.getDriverTester<MyWidgetDriver>(
          driverBuilder: (context) => MyWidgetDriver(context, theService: mockTheService),
          parentWidgetBuilder: (driverWidget) {
            return MultiProvider(
              providers: [
                Provider<SomeService>.value(value: mockSomeService),
                Provider<AnotherService>.value(value: mockAnotherService),
              ],
              child: driverWidget,
            );
          });
}
```

As you can see, you create the `Driver` by calling `tester.getDriverTester(...)`.  
This will return you a `DriverTester`. You use this driverTester to test your driver.

In this example, we are creating a driver called `MyWidgetDriver`.
It has some internal dependencies which it resolves from the `BuildContext` (`SomeService` and `AnotherService`) and one dependency which gets passed in as a parameter to the constructor.

In the `driverBuilder` you pass a builder which creates your `Driver`.
There you can provide all mocked dependencies which you pass in via the constructor. E.g. the `theService`.

The other two dependencies needs to be in the build context when the driver gets created.
So we need to put the mocked versions of these dependencies in a widget above the `Driver`.
This is done via the optional `parentWidgetBuilder` parameter to the `getDriverTester` method.

There you can pass in a widget which then takes a `driverWidget` as a child.
This `driverWidget` is the widget which contains the `Driver`.

In our example we pass in our mocked services by using the Provider package.

### Testing a Driver

Once you have access to the `DriverTester`, then you can use it to test the `Driver`.  
The `driverTester` has a property called `driver`. This gives you access to an instance of your `Driver`.
This is the `driver` that you will use during your tests.

```dart
testWidgets('Some driver test', (WidgetTester tester) async {
    final driverTester = await tester.getDriverTester<MyWidgetDriver>(...)

    final driver = driverTester.driver;
    expect(driver.buttonText, equals('The expected text'));
```

If your driver updates the widget when some of its dependencies change state, then you easily test this also by awaiting calls to the `notifyWidget()`.

```dart
testWidgets('When isLoggedInStream emits then notifyWidgets is called', (WidgetTester tester) async {
    final driverTester = await tester.getDriverTester<LogInOutButtonDriver>(...)

    isLoggedInStreamController.add(true);
    isLoggedInStreamController.add(false);

    // Wait for the driver to receive 2 notifyWidget calls.
    await driverTester.waitForNotifyWidget(numberOfCalls: 2, requireExactNumberOfCalls: true);
    // Verify no more calls to `notifyWidget`
    await driverTester.verifyNoMoreCallsToNotifyWidget();
```

Here we have a driver which has an internal dependency to a some auth service. Whenever the auth service changes the logged in state, then the driver will call the `notifyWidgets()` an update the widget.

We want to verify that the driver really calls `notifyWidgets()` and to do this we can use a helper function on the driverTester.

There are two functions which helps us here.  
First the `waitForNotifyWidget` will wait until the specified number of calls to `notifyWidgets()` have been reached. If you never get enough calls, then the `waitForNotifyWidget` will timeout and your test will fail. You can pass in the timeout duration as a parameter to the method. It defaults to 1 seconds.

Second, you can use the `verifyNoMoreCallsToNotifyWidget` to wait and check that no more calls are made to the `notifyWidgets()`. You can control how long the method will wait and check for call by passing in a timeout duration to the method. The default value is 1 second.
